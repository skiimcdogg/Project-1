                <!-- <p class="parag p1 not-displayed">- Of course, if there is some blue smoke coming out of the engine,
                    it means that some oil is burning with you're gasoline (due to turbo problem for example).
                    It would be white with water and black with too much gasoline ! </p>
                <p class="parag p2 not-displayed">- Fun fact, that thing happened to me on my 307 (not Bugatti), if you're hear a
                    noise (or maybe not) and you don't
                    charge you're batterie AND the air-conditionning doesn't work anymore, it means that the accessory
                    belt (who is attached to the alternator and the A/C) is broken.
                </p>
                <p class="parag p3 not-displayed">- yeah you saw the add, and now you have to know that if the impact is in you're
                    field of vision, you'll have to change the entire windshield. May be Carglass will put the resin but
                    normally they don't have the right to do so.</p>
                <p class="parag p4 not-displayed">- In case the front tire is flat, first of all, you'll have to change both cause of
                    the wear pattern between new and old tire. Secondly, if you change tires, you take those from the
                    back to put them in the front, otherwise the rubber will harden and will have no more adhesion ! </p> -->
